json-htmlize
============

Creates an HTML representation of a JSON object, for node and browser.


Installing
==========
```
npm install --save json-htmlize
```

* Browser : no dependencies !
* node.js : `jsdom` is a dependency which you'll have to install using `npm install --save jsdom@3`.

Usage
=====

```javascript
var htmlize = require('json-htmlize');

// to DOM element
var html = htmlize.toHtmlDom({name: "mongo", type: "db", type: "nosql-database"}); 

// to string
var htmlString = htmlize.toHtmlString({name: "mongo", type: "db", type: "nosql-database"}); 
```

examples
========

```javascript
var s = require('json-htmlize');

var dom = s.toHtmlDom({name: "mongo", type: "db", type: "nosql-database"}); // returns a dom node.

document.body.appendChild(dom); // pretty print your json object right in the browser.

// you can also obtain the dom generated as a string

var htmlString = s.toHtmlString({name: "mongo", type: "db", type: "nosql-database"}); 

console.log(htmlString);
```

prints out:
```
"<span>{</span><div style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>name:  </strong><span>mongo</span>,</div><div style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>type:  </strong><span>nosql-database</span></div><span>}</span>"
```


Why?
====
I just created this when I was learning to create a node module. I've seen several apps backed by mongodb which provide a gui where dumping your json object stored in the database is a common need. This means everyone who writes one of those things is implementing their own version of json to html convertor. I had to do it while creating MongoMan. This is really just an attempt to provide something that works out of the box when someone needs do json to html conversion.
