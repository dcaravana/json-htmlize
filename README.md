Why?
====
I just created this when I was learning to create a node module. I've seen several apps backed by mongodb which provide a gui where dumping your json object stored in the database is a common need. This means everyone who writes one of those things is implementing their own version of json to html convertor. I had to do it while creating MongoMan. This is really just an attempt to provide something that works out of the box when someone needs do json to html conversion.
